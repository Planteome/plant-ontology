comment: A lateral root primordium may arise from cells of a pericycle (PO:0006203) in a root, as in most seed plants (pericyclic lateral root primordium; PO:0025492), or from cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) or other tissue in ferns and some seed plants (non-pericyclic lateral root primordium: PO:0025493). Transition from lateral root primordium to lateral root occurs with the formation of a root cap (PO:0020123), shortly after the development of a root apical meristem (PO:0020147), which can occur before the lateral root penetrates the exterior of the parent root.

comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

Compare with collenchyma cells (PO:0000075) that are always alive at maturity, have irregularly thickened primary cell walls, and do not have lignified secondary cell walls. Collenchyma cells provides flexibility while sclerenchyma cells provide hardness. Sclerenchyma cells include plant fiber cells (PO:0025407) and sclerid cells (PO:0025418).

Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system.

comment: Heartwood has ceased to function in storage and conduction, and the reserve materials have been removed or converted into heartwood substances. It is generally darker colored than sapwood (PO:0004513) and is found in the center of a shoot axis (PO:0025029) or root (PO:0009005), interior to the sapwood. Heartwood forms at the end of a cell death stage of secondary xylem (PO:0025466).

comment: May be a single or double layer. Usually crushed by the endothecium and therefore almost invariably degenerates early during anther development. In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

comment: While the abaxial side of the leaf is usually the lower surface, the vascular leaves (PO:0009025) of some plants may not have an obvious adaxial or abaxial side such as the leaves of many xerophytic (arid-adapted) species. The adaxial and abaxial side may appear considerably more rounded and this could be due to early activity of the vascular leaf adaxial meristem (PO:0025401) and/or leaf abaxial meristem (PO:0025401).  In other cases, such as Alstromeria, the leaves may be twisted or resupinate.

comment: While the adaxial side of the leaf is usually the upper surface, the vascular leaves (PO:0009025) of some plants may not have an obvious adaxial or abaxial side such as the leaves of many xerophytic (arid-adapted) species. The adaxial and abaxial side may appear considerably more rounded and this could be due to early activity of the vascular leaf adaxial meristem (PO:0025401) and/or leaf abaxial meristem (PO:0025401). In other cases, such as Alstromeria, the leaves may be twisted or resupinate.

comment: Contributes to primary thickening of a shoot axis (PO:0025029), adventitious (shoot-borne) root (PO:0000042) formation, and formation of linkages between shot axis (PO:0000039), leaf (PO:0000036), and root (PO:0003011) vascular systems. Contiguous with the shoot apical meristem (PO:0020148) in some species, but not all. Produces more or less distinct vascular bundles (PO:0005020) surrounded by ground tissue (PO:0025059), as opposed to the more or less continuous xylem (PO:0005352) and phloem (PO:0005417) produced by a vascular cambium (PO:0005598). A primary thickening meristem is a multi-layered structure, compared to the single layer of a cambium. Found in many monocotyledons.

comment: Hydathodes may have one or more pores that are similar to stomata but lack the ability to open and close. Hydathodes are involved in the release of water or xylem sap through pores via guttation or secretion. Generally, hydathodes are located at the end of a minor vein in a phyllome. In many plants, hydathodes includes a portion of thin-walled parenchyma between the tracheary elements and the pore, known as an epithem. In some plants, hydathodes are associated with secretory tissue.

def: "A whole plant fruit development stage (PO:0025500) that begins when the first fruit (PO:0009001) on a whole plant (PO:0000003) begins the process of ripening (GO:0009835) in a way which, in case there are other fruits, the majority of the other fruits start to ripen continuously therewith, and ends with earliest of the following: (1) the whole plant begins a sporophyte senescent stage (PO:0007017), (2) the whole plant begins a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), or (3) all fruits on the whole plant are finished ripening." [Poc:curators]
comment: Succeeds a whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042). This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant. For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). Although individual fruits are undergoing fruit ripening (GO:0009835), which is a type of senescence, during this stage, the whole plant is not yet undergoing multicelluar organism senescence (GO:0010259). An iteroparous species generally will have only one fruit ripening stage in its life, while a semelparous species may have multiple fruit ripening stage in its life. A whole plant fruit ripening stage may be followed by a sporophyte senescent stage, as in case (1) or by a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), as in case (2). In evergreen species and species that fruit multiple times during a growing season, a plant may have multiple fruit development stages without entering dormancy or senescence, as in case (3). In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) has ended. In some plants, fruit may continue to ripen after the whole plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage and left the whole plant fruit ripening stage. Some plants may never enter a whole plant fruit ripening stage, because fruits only begin to ripen after the plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage. Although the use of synonyms like "10-dough stage in sorghum" properly refer to the development of an individual fruit, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

def: "A sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002) during which a sporophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The sporophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the sporophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the sporophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. The sporophyte senescent stage may succeed the sporophyte reproductive stage in monocarpic plants that die after reproducing, such as annuals. This stage is distinct from sporophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant (PO:0000003). For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit development stage (PO:0001002). An iteroparous plant will only have one fruit formation stage in its life,  while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit formation stages during its life. In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the fruit ripening stage of whole plant (PO:0007042) has begun. Although the use of synonyms like "07-milk stage in rice" properly refer to the development of an individual fruits, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the sporophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of a seed, bud, or other plant structure. Dormancy of a plant may be preceded by the senescence of its parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system herbaceous perennials and by the formation of dormant buds. The end of dormancy in a sporophyte is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a sporophyte dormant stage are the resurrection plants Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and Craterostigma plantagineum (an angiosperm) while they are dessicated, and deciduous woody plants and herbaceous perennials or biennials that have a dormant stage in response to drought or cold.

comment: Succeeds a plant zygote stage (PO:0001097). A sporophyte may begin to senesce or die from other causes before producing sporangia. Developmental vegetative growth (GO:0080186) can also occur during the reproductive stage.

comment: This term and its sub-classes apply to an individual flower (PO:000904). During this stage, a flower undergoes the process of flower development (GO:0009908), defined as the process whose specific outcome is the progression of the flower over time, from its formation to the mature structure.  For the development stage of a whole plant (PO:0000003), use whole plant flowering stage (PO:0007016).

[PMID:2152125, POC:curators, POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: In most species, flowering stage (anthesis) is when the flower is open and ends with pollination.  During this stage, the process of anther dehiscence (GO:0009901) usually occurs, defined as the dehiscence of an anther to release the pollen grains contained within it. This term applies to an individual flower (PO:000904).

comment: Many species have juvenile leaves at the base of the stem, adult leaves at the apex, and transition leaves in between. In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. Transition leaves may have mosaics of juvenile and adult tissues, as in Brachypodium.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

The end of the embryo stage varies among taxa; the beginning of a seed germination stage (PO:0007057) in seed plants, formation of the first vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in pteridophytes, the beginning of development of a sporangium (PO:0025094) in bryophytes, or the beginning of the formation of a plant organ (PO:0009008) such as a root (PO:0009005), shoot axis (PO:0025029), or vascular leaf (PO:0009025) in a cultured plant embryo (PO:0000010).

comment: In some cases, a gynoecium (PO:0009062) may consist of only one carpel, in which case annotations should go on carpel (PO:0009030). The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium, but if a gynoecium consists of a single carpel, then pistil may be used synonymously with carpel. If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type.

comment: An inflorescence is a reproductive shoot system from which at least two flowers develop. The growth pattern of an inflorescence may be monopodial (single main shoot axis), sympodial (growth only occurs from axillary meristems), or both. An inflorescence axis (PO:0020122) can be determinate or indeterminate. An inflorescence flower pedicel (PO:0009052) is the ultimate axis in an inflorescence. The flower (PO:0009046) of many plants, for example Magnolia spp., is solitary.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: The coleoptile is an outgrowth or part of the scutellum (PO:0020110) (which is a modified, haustorial cotyledon (PO:0020030)).  Develops separate from the shoot apical meristem (PO:0020148).  Found in Poaceae and other monocotyledons such as Zingiberaceae. Protects the emerging shoot system (PO:0009006) as it grows through the soil.

comment: Common in monocots, including species of Poaceae such as Zea mays. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352). In Zea mays, development of the gynoecium ridge of the upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear occurs via continued overgrowth of the shoot apex (which becomes the ovule primordium) by a ring of gynoecial tissue, leading to the formation of a stylar canal that is detected as a slight protuberance on the mature ovary. Early development of the gynoecium ridge of the lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear is very similar to that of the upper floret of the pedicellate spikelet of ear, except the development does not proceed beyond the early ridge stage.

def: "A plant sperm cell (PO:0000084) that is part of the pollen (PO:0025281)." [PMID:20298228, POC:curators]
comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: Refers to organism substance (CARO:0000004) which is defined as: Material anatomical entity in a gaseous, liquid, semisolid or solid state; produced by anatomical structures or derived from inhaled and ingested substances that have been modified by anatomical structures as they pass through the body and that does not have inherent 3D shape generated by coordinated expression of the organism's own genome. For plants, the word "body" refers to a whole plant, or part thereof.  Includes substances such as latex, xylem sap, phloem sap, resin, mucilage, oil, cuticle, cutin, and sporopollenin.

comment: A pollen sac is a microsporangium in seed plants. In angiosperms, a single, unfused pollen sac may contain an anther locule or several pollen sacs may fuse so they contain a single anther locule. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: May function in providing nutrition to developing sporocytes or pollen. May have one or more layers of cells. May break down as spores mature. A tapetum does not develop in some plants, such as Psilotum. In angiosperms, the tapetum develops from one of the parietal layers. In non-seed plants, the tapetum may develop from the outer cells of archesporium or from the inner-most layer of the sporangium wall. The tapetum may be one of two types ameboid or secretory/glandular.

comment: A unifacial leaf may be round in cross-section (terete) or it may be laminar (ensiform), in which case lamina development is in a median plane (perpendicular to the axis), rather than a transverse plane (tangent to the axis). Unifacial leaves may be bifacial at the leaf base. Many unifacial leaves develop by reduced (or absent) activity of the marginal meristems and increased activity of the adaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an adaxial surface (e.g., Acacia phyllodes). However, some develop by increased activity of the abaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an abaxial surface. Note that unifacial leaves may have two sides, as in ensiform leaves, but both sides arise from the same surface of the leaf meristem (abaxial or adaxial).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) may continue developmental vegetative growth (GO:0080186) after it has entered the reproductive stage, and it may revert to a stage in which it is no longer producing gametantia, but once it has initiated a single gametangium, it remains in the reproductive stage until senescence or death by some other cause.

comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant (PO:0000003) in the gametophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of other plant structures. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a gametophyte dormant stage are the moss Polytrichum commune after it has undergone dessication (a type of resurrection plant), the boreal moss Polytrichum alpestre, whose shoot systems have annual growth segments due to a period of dormancy during the winter, the female gametophyte of Ginkgo biloba, which is dormant before fertilization, and dormancy of plant spores.

def: "A gametophyte development stage (PO:0028003) during which a gametophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The gametophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the gametophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the gametophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. This stage is distinct from gametophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

May bear remnants or scars of detached leaves. Adventitious roots may develop from the base of a corm, and these may be contractile, pulling the corm into the soil. Examples include Gladiolus and Crocus. The pseudobulb of an orchid is equivalent to a corm. A corm is very similar to a rhizome (PO:0004542) with very short sympodial units, although not all corms have sympodial growth.

def: "A lateral root (PO:0020121) that is erect and protrudes above the surface of the soil or water." [ISBN:9780881928501]
comment: Pneumatophores are found in trees that live in flooded habitats such as mangroves, and often have many lenticels (PO:0000031) which may provide oxygen to below-ground roots growing in flooded soils. Knee roots are a type of pneumatophore in which the lateral root first grows upward, then turns and grows back down into the substrate, forming a knee-like bend. Note that a pneumatophore differs from a prop root (PO:0000044), which is formed at a stem node above the ground, and grows downward into the soil.

comment: Aids plant in climbing. May be branched, may have adhesive disks at its distal end, may be woody, and may bear small leaves. A stem apex tendril differs from a branch tendril in that it arises from the shoot apical meristem, rather than in an axil. However, a shoot apex tendril may arise either from the apex itself, in which case it is terminal, or from the side of an apical meristem, in which case it is a lateral structure. In the latter case, the main stem of the plant undergoes sympodial growth. A stem apex tendril is often located on the opposite side of a stem from a leaf at the same node, as in Vitaceae. See also leaf tendril (PO:0025361), leaflet tendril (PO:0025362), leaf apex tendril (PO:0025363), branch tendril (PO:0025364),  leaf rachis tendril (PO:0025366), and prophyll tendril (PO:0025365).

comment: A seed dormancy process (GO:0010162) is a dormancy process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken in a seed. Seed dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth in a seed, including the embryo contained therein, that can be reactivated. It often requires special conditions for reactivation, such as specific temperature, scarification, or leaching of inhibitors. Seed dormancy includes dormancy of the embryo and the seed coat, although\nthese may not begin or end simultaneously. Not all seeds go through a seed dormant stage. Most seeds that go through a dormant stage do so only one time.

[POC:wood_curators]
comment: During this stage, the cells of a portion of secondary xylem are undergoing cell death (GO:0008219), sometimes called apoptosis. Death of the tracheary elements and non-septate xylem fiber cells generally precedes the death of secondary parenchyma cells and septate fiber cells.

comment: Functions in storage. This term should be used for tubers derived from roots (PO:0009005), as found in Cassava or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), not for tubers derived from branches (PO:0025073), as found in potatoes and yams. Use the term shoot axis tuber (PO:0004543), aerial tuber (PO:0004548), or subterranean tuber (PO:0004547) for tubers derived from branches. A tuberous root tuber may be distinguished from a tuber that is derived from a branch by the presence of a root cap (PO:0020123) early in development, or the presence of lateral roots (PO:0020121) or their remnants. Sometimes tuber roots bear vegetative buds (PO:0000058) like a tuber derived from a branch. A tuberous root tuber usually develops from a shoot-borne root (PO:0000042) or a lateral root (PO:0020121).

def: "A sporophyte reproductive stage that begins when a fruit (PO:0009001) on a whole plant (PO:0000003) that is not currently participating in a whole plant fruit development stage begins a fruit initiation stage (PO:0025503), and ends with the earliest of the following: (1) the whole plant begins a sporophyte senescent stage (PO:0007017), (2) the whole plant begins a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), or (3) all fruits on the whole plant are finished ripening." [POC:curators]
comment: A whole plant fruit development stage begins with the beginning of whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) and ends with the end of a whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010). A whole plant fruit development stage can be thought of as a fruiting cycle for a whole plant that begins when the plant starts to produce fruit and ends when all of the fruit on the plant are ripe, unless the plant enters a sporophyte senescent stage or sporophyte dormant stage before all the fruit is ripe. An iteroparous plant will have a single whole plant fruit development stage during its life of whole plant (PO:0025337), while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit development stages during its life, each of which will be part of the same instance of a sporophyte reproductive stage. Some plants retain their fruit after ripening and through dormancy, and thus may begin a new whole fruit development stage while fruits from the previous whole plant fruit development stage are still present.

comment: Succeeds a fruit formation stage (PO:0025501). This stage is to be used for an individual fruit.  Fruit ripening (GO:0009835) is defined as: an aging process that has as participant a fruit. Ripening causes changes in one or more characteristics of a fruit (color, aroma, flavor, texture, hardness, cell wall structure) and may make it more attractive to animals and aid in seed dispersal. For the development stage of a whole plant (PO:0000003), use whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophyte development stage but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002). A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophyte development stage, but not in the case of apospory. A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exist by death at any point in its development. In seed plants, the whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exists through transformation, such as when pollen (PO:0025281) releases its pollen sperm cells (PO:0025121) or when a plant embryo (PO:0009009) begins to develop within an embryo sac (PO:0025074) of an angiosperm. During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes (PO:0025006) by mitosis.

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

The spore capsule calyptra is a membranous or hairy cap or hood, composed of gametophytic tissue (venter; PO:0030038) that protects the embryonic sporophyte within the archegonium (PO:0025126). In some species, it may persist after the sporophyte develops and gets carried upward as the seta (PO:0030032) elongates. The spore capsule calyptra is usually lost before the spores are released, and its shape can be used for identification purposes.

comment: The pericarp (PO:0009084) of some legume fruit (PO:0030100), such as peanuts, is constricted between each seed, but these constrictions are due to a lack of support of the pericarp (PO:0009084) in the space between the seeds (PO:0009010). Contrastingly, the constrictions in the pericarp of loment fruits (PO:0030101) are sclerified and contain regions where cell death leads to disarticulation of the fruit (PO:0009001). Examples: some members of Fabaceae, including Mimosa and Desmodium spp.

comment: Caryopsis fruit (PO:0030104) is characteristic of the Poaceae (the grass family). Caryopsis fruits develop from a pseudomonomerous gyneocium (PO:0009062), and contain only a single seed due to the abortion of two of the three carpels (PO:0009030). The pericarp of caryopsis fruits of some bamboo species is somewhat fleshy at maturity and is fused to the seed coat; these fruits are referred to in the literature as bacoid caryopses. Examples: barley (Hordeum vulgare), rice (Oryza spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), corn (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), oat (Avena spp.), zebra grass (Miscanthus spp.), Tausch’s goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), stiff brome (Brachypodium distachyon), cutgrass (Leersia perrieri), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica).

[POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
