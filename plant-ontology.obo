In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

comment: Found in heterosporous ferns and seed plants. May also give rise to sterile cells. In the majority of flowering plants, including Arabidopsis, the female archesporial cell elongates and polarizes longitudinally, and directly differentiates into the megasporocyte or megaspore mother cell. In some flowering plants, it undergoes a periclinal division, and subsequently the inner cell differentiates into the megasporocyte.

comment: An embryo is generally formed after the first division of a zygote, but in the case of adventitious embryos, somatic embryos, other embryos that arise through apogamy, and cultured haploid embryos, it is formed after the division of a single cell that is not a zygote. The end of the embryonic phase varies among taxa. In seed plants, the embryonic phase ends with germination. In pteridophytes, the embryonic phase ends with the formation of the first true leaf after the cotyledon(s). In bryophytes, the embryonic phase ends when the apical cell stops dividing and the sporangium begins to develop. In cultured plant embryos, the embryonic phase ends when organs (roots, shoot axes, or leaves) begin to form.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary\ninflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch.\nThe peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive\ngrowth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: It is not precisely defined how far toward the base from the tip a leaf apex extends. For the apical most portion of a leaf, use the term leaf tip. If you are annotating to this term, please add an additional annotation to vascular leaf (PO:0009025) or non-vascular leaf (PO:0025075), depending on the species. All annotations for angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes should go to vascular leaf and all annotations for bryophytes should go to non-vascular leaf.

comment: A carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cell found in bryophytes in axes and leaves in the gametophytic phase and in the seta in the sporophytic phase. Leptoids have no nucleus at maturity. Carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cells in bryophytes range from conducting parenchyma cells that are indistinguishable from other parenchyma cells to 'leptoids sensu strictu' that are structurally comparable to sieve elements in vascular plants, as well as many intermediate forms. The term leptoid is used for cells that are distinguishable from other parenchyma cells, whether they be intermediate or leptoids sensu strictu.

def: "A gynoecium in the early stages of development, characterized as a ridge on the abaxial surface of the floral meristem that develops from a gynoecium primordium." [PMID:10077498, POC:curators]
comment: Common in monocots, including species of Poaceae such as Zea mays. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352). In Zea mays, development of the gynoecium ridge of the upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear occurs via continued overgrowth of the shoot apex (which becomes the ovule primordium) by a ring of gynoecial tissue, leading to the formation of a stylar canal that is detected as a slight protuberance on the mature ovary. Early development of the gynoecium ridge of the lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear is very similar to that of the upper floret of the pedicellate spikelet of ear, except the development does not proceed beyond the early ridge stage.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In Angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to endosperm.

comment: During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes by mitosis. In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophytic phase but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophytic phase. A whole plant in the gametophytic phase usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophytic phase, but not in the case of apospory.

def: "A single meristematic cell at the tip of a plant structure where apical growth occurs." [ISBN:0962073342, ISBN:9780473067304]
comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

Includes epidermal rhizoids that grow from the epidermis of bryophytes and pteridophytes in the gametophytic phase or from the stems of some monocots, protonemal rhizoids that branch from a protonema, and rhizoids that develop from a basal cell of a gametophore bud.
