comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

comment: Sieve tube elements have sieve areas that are specialized into those with wide pores in sieve plates and those with narrow pores in lateral sieve areas. Sieve tube elements may have inclined end walls with compound or simple sieve plates. Typical of angiosperms. Differ from sieve cells (PO:0025415), which have less pronounced specialization of sieve areas and no sieve plates.

comment: Tracheary elements are dead at maturity, are more or less elongated, and have pits of various types in the cell wall. Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system. Tracheary elements can be distinguished from fiber cells (PO:0025407) by the presence of bordered pits, although there are intermediate forms called fiber tracheids (PO:0000355).

That stem then sends out one or more stolons from its axillary buds and the process is reiterated. A unique part of this process is that the first internode of a stolon is very long and then the shoot becomes an erect rosette.

comment: May be a single or double layer. Usually crushed by the endothecium and therefore almost invariably degenerates early during anther development. In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The sporophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the sporophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the sporophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. The sporophyte senescent stage may succeed the sporophyte reproductive stage in monocarpic plants that die after reproducing, such as annuals. This stage is distinct from sporophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: Includes emergence of a Zea mays inflorescence from a flag leaf sheath, following booting. In US cornbelt maize (including B73) the tassel fully emerges about 2-3 days prior to silk emergence from husk leaves. At this time the ear and husk may still be enclosed within its leaf sheath depending on the variety and environmental conditions.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the sporophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of a seed, bud, or other plant structure. Dormancy of a plant may be preceded by the senescence of its parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system herbaceous perennials and by the formation of dormant buds. The end of dormancy in a sporophyte is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a sporophyte dormant stage are the resurrection plants Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and Craterostigma plantagineum (an angiosperm) while they are dessicated, and deciduous woody plants and herbaceous perennials or biennials that have a dormant stage in response to drought or cold.

In seed plants, the plant embryo stage ends with the seed germination stage (PO:0007057). In pteridophytes, the plant embryo stage ends with the formation of the first vascular leaf (PO:0009025). In bryophytes, the plant embryo stage ends when the seta meristematic apical cell (PO:0030016) stops dividing and the sporangium (PO:0025094) begins to develop.

comment: Succeeds the plant zygote stage (PO:0001097). The plant embryo stage generally starts after the first division of a plant zygote (PO:0000423), but in the case of an adventitious embryo, somatic embryo (PO:0025302), other embryos that arise through apogamy, or microspore-derived cultured plant embryo (PO:0025305), it is formed after the division of a single cell that is not a zygote.

def: "A whole plant (PO:0000003) that participates in the plant embryo stage (PO:0007631)." [POC:Curators]
comment: A plant embryo is generally formed after the first division of a plant zygote (PO:0000423), but in the case of an adventitious embryo (nucellar plant embryo (PO:0004537)), somatic embryo (PO:0025302), other embryos that arise through apogamy, or microspore-derived cultured plant embryo (PO:0025305), it is formed after the division of a single cell that is not a zygote.  The end of the embryo stage varies among taxa. In seed plants, the  plant embryo stage (PO:0007631) ends with germination. In pteridophytes, the plant embryo stage ends with the formation of the first vascular leaf (PO:0009025). In bryophytes, the plant embryo stage ends when the embryo apical cell (PO:0025284) stops dividing and the sporangium (PO:0025094) begins to develop. In cultured plant embryos (PO:0000010), the plant embryo stage ends when a plant organ (PO:0009008) such as a root (PO:0009005), shoot axis\n(PO:0025029), or leaf (PO:0025034) begins to form.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: A leaf lamina is usually dorsiventrally flattened, but may be flattened in a median plant (perpendicular to the axis) in the case of phyllodes (PO:0025335) or other ensiform leaves (PO:0025333). This term should not be used for leaves that are not laminar (flat), like round leaves in Allium or needle-like leaves in Pinus or some Proteaceae. If you are annotating to this term, please add an additional annotation to vascular leaf (PO:0009025) or non-vascular leaf (PO:0025075), depending on the species. All annotations for angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes should go to vascular leaf and all annotations for bryophytes should go to non-vascular leaf.

comment: May be simple or compound. Found in lycophytes such as Selaginella and Lycopodium, sphenophytes such as Equisetum, gymnosperms such as cycad, conifers, gnetophytes and the pollen producing structures of Gingko. The term cone is often used for strobili that are woody. Flowers are sometimes considered bisexual strobili. Some flowering plants such as Alnus have inflorescences called catkins that resemble strobili, but are not.

def: "A gynoecium in the early stages of development, characterized as a ridge on the abaxial surface of the floral meristem that develops from a gynoecium primordium." [PMID:10077498, POC:Curators]
comment: Common in monocots, including species of Poaceae such as Zea mays. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352). In Zea mays, development of the gynoecium ridge of the upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear occurs via continued overgrowth of the shoot apex (which becomes the ovule primordium) by a ring of gynoecial tissue, leading to the formation of a stylar canal that is detected as a slight protuberance on the mature ovary. Early development of the gynoecium ridge of the lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear is very similar to that of the upper floret of the pedicellate spikelet of ear, except the development does not proceed beyond the early ridge stage.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In Angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to endosperm.

comment: May function in providing nutrition to developing sporocytes or pollen. May have one or more layers of cells. May break down as spores mature. A tapetum does not develop in some plants, such as Psilotum. In angiosperms, the tapetum develops from one of the parietal layers.

comment: A unifacial leaf may be round in cross-section (terete) or it may be laminar (ensiform), in which case lamina development is in a median plane (perpendicular to the axis), rather than a transverse plane (tangent to the axis). Unifacial leaves may be bifacial at the leaf base. Many unifacial leaves develop by reduced (or absent) activity of the marginal meristems and increased activity of the adaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an adaxial surface (e.g., Acacia phyllodes). However, some develop by increased activity of the abaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an abaxial surface. Note that unifacial leaves may have two sides, as in ensiform leaves, but both sides arise from the same surface of the leaf meristem (abaxial or adaxial).

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the gametophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of other plant structures. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a gametophyte dormant stage are the moss Polytrichum commune after it has undergone dessication (a type of resurrection plant), the boreal moss Polytrichum alpestre, whose shoot systems have annual growth segments due to a period of dormancy during the winter, the female gametophyte of Ginkgo biloba, which is dormant before fertilization, and dormancy of plant spores.

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The gametophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the gametophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the gametophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. This stage is distinct from gametophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: Found in cacti and other succulents. The upper part of a leaf from which a tubercle develops is usually shed early in development. Tubercles are often conical, but they may merge with those directly above and below to form ribs, as in saguaro (Carnegiea), or they may elongate, as in species of pincushion cacti (Mammillaria). In species with tubercles, the areole (PO:xxxxxxx) is often found at the distal end of the tubercle. The areole originates in the axil of the leaf that becomes the tubercle but is displaced to the tip of a tubercle through adnation (fusion of two organs of different types).

comment: Found in Cactaceae. Appears as a cluster of spines. May be covered in trichomes. In species with tubercles, the areole is often found at the distal end of the tubercle. The areole originates in the axil of the leaf that becomes the tubercle but is displaced to the tip of a tubercle through adnation (fusion of two organs of different types).

comment: May serve as a storage or perennating organ. Usually underground. A corm differs from a bulb (PO:0025356) in that it does not have fleshy leaves\nor leaf bases but usually has scale leaves or remnants of dry leaf sheaths\nthat form a protective covering around it. May bear remnants or scars of\ndetached leaves. Adventitious roots may develop from the base of a corm,\nand these may be contractile, pulling the corm into the soil. Examples\ninclude Gladiolus and Crocus. The pseudobulb of an orchid is equivalent to\na corm. A corm is very similar to a rhizome (PO:0004542) with very short sympodial units, although not all corms have sympodial growth.

comment: Pneumatophores are found in trees that live in flooded habitats such as mangroves and often have many lenticels. May provide oxygen to below ground roots growing in flooded soils. Sometime prop roots (PO:0000044) may act as breathing roots. In that case, the annotation should go to PO:0000044, whereas this term should be used for breathing roots arising at or below the soil or water surface. Knee roots are a type of pneumatophore in which the lateral root first grows upward, then turns and grows back down into the substrate, forming a knee-like bend.

comment: Aids plant in climbing. May be branched, may have adhesive disks at its distal end, may be woody, and may bear small leaves. A stem apex tendril differs from a branch tendril in that it arises from the shoot apical meristem, rather than in an axil. However, a shoot apex tendril may arise either from the apex itself, in which case it is terminal, or from the side of an apical meristem, in which case it is a lateral structure. In the latter case, the main stem of the plant undergoes sympodial growth. A stem apex tendril is often located on the opposite side of a stem from a leaf at the same node, as in Vitaceae.

comment: A seed dormancy process (GO:0010162) is a dormancy process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken in a seed. Seed dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth in a seed, including the embryo contained therein, that can be reactivated. It often requires special conditions for reactivation, such as specific temperature, scarification, or leaching of inhibitors. Seed dormancy includes dormancy of the embryo and the seed coat, although\nthese may not begin or end simultaneously. Not all seeds go through a seed dormant stage. Most seeds that go through a dormant stage do so only one time.

comment: Often found in reaction wood in dicots and in some phloem fiber cells (PO:0004519), as in Linum usitatissimum. In gelatinous fiber cells, the inner layer of the cell wall is a cellulosic gelatinous-layer or G-layer, which may be relatively porous and less compact than the outer layers of the cell wall and may absorb water and swell.

[POC:curators]
comment: During a secondary xylem development stage (also called a wood development stage), the cells of secondary xylem (PO:0005848), including tracheary elements (PO:0000290), xylem fiber cells (PO:0000274), and wood parenchyma cells (PO:0004525) undergo cellular developmental processes (GO:0048869) such as cell division (GO:0051301), cell growth (GO:0016049), cell differentiation (GO:0030154), or cell death (GO:0008219).

A whole plant in the sporophytic phase usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts).

comment: During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes by mitosis. In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophytic phase but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophytic phase. A whole plant in the gametophytic phase usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophytic phase, but not in the case of apospory.

def: "A plant structure that is a uniseriate filament with positive geotropism that grows from an epidermis or protonema." [ISBN:0962073342, ISBN:unknown]
comment: May be unicellular or multicellular. Serves to anchor the plant to the substrate, and may function in nutrient and water uptake. Usually lacks chlorophyll. Includes epidermal rhizoids that grow from the epidermis of bryophytes and pteridophytes in the gametophytic phase or from the stems of some monocots, protonemal rhizoids that branch from a protonema, and rhizoids that develop from a basal cell of a gametophore bud.

comment: Term used for bryophytes. May have one or more layers. An amphithecium may give rise to an exothecium and other layer of a sporangium wall (jacket layer or layers). In true mosses, the amphithecium gives rise to the sporangium wall and the peristome. In hornworts and peat mosses, it gives rise to the sporangium wall and sporogenous tissue.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.
