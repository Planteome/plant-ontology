def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The sporophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the sporophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the sporophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. The sporophyte senescent stage may succeed the sporophyte reproductive stage in monocarpic plants that die after reproducing, such as annuals. This stage is distinct from sporophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

In US cornbelt maize (including B73) the tassel fully emerges about 2-3 days prior to silk emergence from husk leaves. At this time the ear and husk may still be enclosed within its leaf sheath depending on the variety and environmental conditions.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the sporophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of a seed, bud, or other plant structure. Dormancy of a plant may be preceded by the senescence of its parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system herbaceous perennials and by the formation of dormant buds. The end of dormancy in a sporophyte is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a sporophyte dormant stage are the resurrection plants Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and Craterostigma plantagineum (an angiosperm) while they are dessicated, and deciduous woody plants and herbaceous perennials or biennials that have a dormant stage in response to drought or cold.

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the gametophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of other plant structures. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a gametophyte dormant stage are the moss Polytrichum commune after it has undergone dessication (a type of resurrection plant), the boreal moss Polytrichum alpestre, whose shoot systems have annual growth segments due to a period of dormancy during the winter, the female gametophyte of Ginkgo biloba, which is dormant before fertilization, and dormancy of plant spores.

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The gametophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the gametophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the gametophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. This stage is distinct from gametophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

comment: A seed dormancy process (GO:0010162) is a dormancy process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken in a seed. Seed dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth in a seed, including the embryo contained therein, that can be reactivated. It often requires special conditions for reactivation, such as specific temperature, scarification, or leaching of inhibitors. Seed dormancy includes dormancy of the embryo and the seed coat, although\nthese may not begin or end simultaneously. Not all seeds go through a seed dormant stage. Most seeds that go through a dormant stage do so only one time.

comment: During a this stage, cells of secondary xylem undergo cell differentiation (GO:0030154), including cell growth (GO:0016049), cell morphogenisis (GO:0000902), or cell death (GO:0008219). Cell death is considered part of differentiation in secondary xylem, because it is an essential part of wood development. This stage succeeds the last cell division in a cell division stage of secondary xylem, even though cell differentiation may begin before all cell division finishes.

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes by mitosis. In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophytic phase but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophytic phase. A whole plant in the gametophytic phase usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophytic phase, but not in the case of apospory.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.
