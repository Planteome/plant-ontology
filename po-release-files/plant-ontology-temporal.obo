comment: In taxa with mature two-celled pollen (PO:0025281), the second mitotic division takes place after pollen germination (GO:0009846), in the germinating pollen tube cell (PO:0025195). Note: This term overlaps with the GO BP term: generative cell mitosis (GO:0055047): The process in which the generative cell divides by mitosis to form two haploid cells. These will subsequently differentiate into sperm cells.

[Poc:curators]
comment: Succeeds a whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042). This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant. For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). Although individual fruits are undergoing fruit ripening (GO:0009835), which is a type of senescence, during this stage, the whole plant is not yet undergoing multicelluar organism senescence (GO:0010259). An iteroparous species generally will have only one fruit ripening stage in its life, while a semelparous species may have multiple fruit ripening stage in its life. A whole plant fruit ripening stage may be followed by a sporophyte senescent stage, as in case (1) or by a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), as in case (2). In evergreen species and species that fruit multiple times during a growing season, a plant may have multiple fruit development stages without entering dormancy or senescence, as in case (3). In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) has ended. In some plants, fruit may continue to ripen after the whole plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage and left the whole plant fruit ripening stage. Some plants may never enter a whole plant fruit ripening stage, because fruits only begin to ripen after the plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage. Although the use of synonyms like "10-dough stage in sorghum" properly refer to the development of an individual fruit, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

comment: The sporophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the sporophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the sporophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. The sporophyte senescent stage may succeed the sporophyte reproductive stage in monocarpic plants that die after reproducing, such as annuals. This stage is distinct from sporophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

In US cornbelt maize (including B73) the tassel fully emerges about 2-3 days prior to silk emergence from husk leaves. At this time the ear and husk may still be enclosed within its leaf sheath depending on the variety and environmental conditions.

comment: This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant (PO:0000003). For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit development stage (PO:0001002). An iteroparous plant will only have one fruit formation stage in its life,  while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit formation stages during its life. In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the fruit ripening stage of whole plant (PO:0007042) has begun. Although the use of synonyms like "07-milk stage in rice" properly refer to the development of an individual fruits, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

comment: Occurs in Poaceae and some other monocotyledons.  May occur simultaneously with coleoptile emergence from the growth medium.  The actual point of emergence from the seed coat (PO:0009088) may not be observed if the seed (PO:0009010) is underneath a growth medium. In a fruit (PO:0009001) with a persistent pericarp (PO:0009084), emergence from the seed coat may not be observed. If the fruit is a caryopsis, the dry pericarp is fused with the seed coat, and emergence from the pericarp is simultaneous with emergence from the seed coat. This terms is used only for seed plants.

def: "A sporophyte development stage during which a sporophyte participates in a dormancy process." [GO:0022611, PO_REF:00009, POC:curators]
comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the sporophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of a seed, bud, or other plant structure. Dormancy of a plant may be preceded by the senescence of its parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system herbaceous perennials and by the formation of dormant buds. The end of dormancy in a sporophyte is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a sporophyte dormant stage are the resurrection plants Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and Craterostigma plantagineum (an angiosperm) while they are dessicated, and deciduous woody plants and herbaceous perennials or biennials that have a dormant stage in response to drought or cold.

comment: A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. This term only applies to a whole plant in the gametophyte stage, not to the dormant stage of other plant structures. The dormant stage may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. Examples of a gametophyte dormant stage are the moss Polytrichum commune after it has undergone dessication (a type of resurrection plant), the boreal moss Polytrichum alpestre, whose shoot systems have annual growth segments due to a period of dormancy during the winter, the female gametophyte of Ginkgo biloba, which is dormant before fertilization, and dormancy of plant spores.

def: "A gametophyte development stage during which a gametophyte participates in multicellular organism senescence." [GO:0010259, POC:curators]
comment: The gametophyte senescent stage is often preceded by the gametophyte reproductive stage, and it ends with death of the gametophyte, either as a result of senescence or some other cause. This stage is distinct from gametophyte dormant stage, in which organs may senesce, but some parts of the plant remain alive. Multicellular organism senescence/aging (GO:0010259) includes loss of functions such as resistance to disease, homeostasis, and fertility, as well processes like cellular senescence, organ senescence, and wear and tear. The POC curators have requested to the GOC that they revise the definition of GO:0010259, to make it more appropriate for plants.

def: "A seed development stage during which a seed participates in a seed dormancy process." [GO:0010162, POC:curators]
comment: A seed dormancy process (GO:0010162) is a dormancy process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken in a seed. Seed dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth in a seed, including the embryo contained therein, that can be reactivated. It often requires special conditions for reactivation, such as specific temperature, scarification, or leaching of inhibitors. Seed dormancy includes dormancy of the embryo and the seed coat, although\nthese may not begin or end simultaneously. Not all seeds go through a seed dormant stage. Most seeds that go through a dormant stage do so only one time.

comment: A whole plant fruit development stage begins with the beginning of whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) and ends with the end of a whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010). A whole plant fruit development stage can be thought of as a fruiting cycle for a whole plant that begins when the plant starts to produce fruit and ends when all of the fruit on the plant are ripe, unless the plant enters a sporophyte senescent stage or sporophyte dormant stage before all the fruit is ripe. An iteroparous plant will have a single whole plant fruit development stage during its life of whole plant (PO:0025337), while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit development stages during its life, each of which will be part of the same instance of a sporophyte reproductive stage. Some plants retain their fruit after ripening and through dormancy, and thus may begin a new whole fruit development stage while fruits from the previous whole plant fruit development stage are still present.

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

comment: In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophyte development stage but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002). A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophyte development stage, but not in the case of apospory. A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exist by death at any point in its development. In seed plants, the whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exists through transformation, such as when pollen (PO:0025281) releases its pollen sperm cells (PO:0025121) or when a plant embryo (PO:0009009) begins to develop within an embryo sac (PO:0025074) of an angiosperm. During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes (PO:0025006) by mitosis.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [BFO:0000062]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
