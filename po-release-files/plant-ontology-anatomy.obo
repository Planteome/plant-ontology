An example of a sterile culture environment is growth on or in a nutrient medium in a Petri dish, culture flask or test tube. Microbes may be intentionally added to the culture environment, such as in co-culture with Agrobacterium.

In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

Hydathodes are involved in the release of water or xylem sap through pores via guttation or secretion. Generally, hydathodes are located at the end of a minor vein in a phyllome. In many plants, hydathodes includes a portion of thin-walled parenchyma between the tracheary elements and the pore, known as an epithem. In some plants, hydathodes are associated with secretory tissue.

comment: Found in heterosporous ferns and seed plants. May also give rise to sterile cells. In the majority of flowering plants, including Arabidopsis, the female archesporial cell elongates and polarizes longitudinally, and directly differentiates into the megasporocyte or megaspore mother cell. In some flowering plants, it undergoes a periclinal division, and subsequently the inner cell differentiates into the megasporocyte.

All annotations for angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes should go to vascular leaf and all annotations for bryophytes should go to non-vascular leaf. The first juvenile leaves in Poaceae are e.g. the embryonic leaves found in the grass kernel (caryopsis).

comment: An embryo is generally formed after the first division of a zygote, but in the case of adventitious embryos, somatic embryos, other embryos that arise through apogamy, and cultured haploid embryos, it is formed after the division of a single cell that is not a zygote. The end of the embryonic phase varies among taxa. In seed plants, the embryonic phase ends with germination. In pteridophytes, the embryonic phase ends with the formation of the first true leaf after the cotyledon(s). In bryophytes, the embryonic phase ends when the apical cell stops dividing and the sporangium begins to develop. In cultured plant embryos, the embryonic phase ends when organs (roots, shoot axes, or leaves) begin to form.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary\ninflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch.\nThe peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive\ngrowth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In Angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to endosperm.

The organ parts are often of the same type (e.g., petioles, carpel walls), but may be of different types. Includes plant structures like a septum that consists of the walls of two fused carpels or a pseudostem that consist of multiple, overlapping leaf sheaths. Unlike a collective plant structure, a collective organ part structure does not contain any complete organs.

The term protonema is also used to refer to the phase of development in which protonemal tissue is produced (see PO:0030006 protonema phase). In some species of moss, the protonema is perennial.

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.
