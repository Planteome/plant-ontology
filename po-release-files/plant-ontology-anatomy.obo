comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

def: "A plant cell (PO:0009002O) that has a lignified cell wall with secondary thickening and bordered pits." [ISBN:0471245208]
comment: Tracheary elements are dead at maturity, are more or less elongated, and have pits of various types in the cell wall. Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system. Tracheary elements can be distinguished from fiber cells (PO:0025407) by the presence of bordered pits, although there are intermediate forms called fiber tracheids (PO:0000355).

comment: May be a single or double layer. Usually crushed by the endothecium and therefore almost invariably degenerates early during anther development. In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. Transition leaves may have mosaics of juvenile and adult tissues, as in Brachypodium.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

Lemma, palea and lodicule are associated with a spikelet floret, but since it is not clear what they correspond to in conventional flowers, no assumptions of homology are made at the present time. To describe a floret of the Asteraceae, use ray flower (PO:0025331) or disk flower (PO:0025332).

comment: A leaf lamina is usually dorsiventrally flattened, but may be flattened in a median plant (perpendicular to the axis) in the case of phyllodes (PO:0025335) or other ensiform leaves (PO:0025333). This term should not be used for leaves that are not laminar (flat), like round leaves in Allium or needle-like leaves in Pinus or some Proteaceae. If you are annotating to this term, please add an additional annotation to vascular leaf (PO:0009025) or non-vascular leaf (PO:0025075), depending on the species. All annotations for angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes should go to vascular leaf and all annotations for bryophytes should go to non-vascular leaf.

comment: May be simple or compound. Found in lycophytes such as Selaginella and Lycopodium, sphenophytes such as Equisetum, gymnosperms such as cycad, conifers, gnetophytes and the pollen producing structures of Gingko. The term cone is often used for strobili that are woody. Flowers are sometimes considered bisexual strobili. Some flowering plants such as Alnus have inflorescences called catkins that resemble strobili, but are not.

comment: Common in monocots, including species of Poaceae such as Zea mays. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352). In Zea mays, development of the gynoecium ridge of the upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear occurs via continued overgrowth of the shoot apex (which becomes the ovule primordium) by a ring of gynoecial tissue, leading to the formation of a stylar canal that is detected as a slight protuberance on the mature ovary. Early development of the gynoecium ridge of the lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear is very similar to that of the upper floret of the pedicellate spikelet of ear, except the development does not proceed beyond the early ridge stage.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In Angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to endosperm.

comment: May function in providing nutrition to developing sporocytes or pollen. May have one or more layers of cells. May break down as spores mature. A tapetum does not develop in some plants, such as Psilotum. In angiosperms, the tapetum develops from one of the parietal layers.

comment: A unifacial leaf may be round in cross-section (terete) or it may be laminar (ensiform), in which case lamina development is in a median plane (perpendicular to the axis), rather than a transverse plane (tangent to the axis). Unifacial leaves may be bifacial at the leaf base. Many unifacial leaves develop by reduced (or absent) activity of the marginal meristems and increased activity of the adaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an adaxial surface (e.g., Acacia phyllodes). However, some develop by increased activity of the abaxial meristem early in development, leading to mature leaves with only an abaxial surface. Note that unifacial leaves may have two sides, as in ensiform leaves, but both sides arise from the same surface of the leaf meristem (abaxial or adaxial).

comment: Found in cacti and other succulents. The upper part of a leaf from which a tubercle develops is usually shed early in development. Tubercles are often conical, but they may merge with those directly above and below to form ribs, as in saguaro (Carnegiea), or they may elongate, as in species of pincushion cacti (Mammillaria). In species with tubercles, the areole (PO:xxxxxxx) is often found at the distal end of the tubercle. The areole originates in the axil of the leaf that becomes the tubercle but is displaced to the tip of a tubercle through adnation (fusion of two organs of different types).

Sometime prop roots (PO:0000044) may act as breathing roots. In that case, the annotation should go to PO:0000044, whereas this term should be used for breathing roots arising at or below the soil or water surface. Knee roots are a type of pneumatophore in which the lateral root first grows upward, then turns and grows back down into the substrate, forming a knee-like bend.

comment: Aids plant in climbing. May be branched, may have adhesive disks at its distal end, may be woody, and may bear small leaves. A stem apex tendril differs from a branch tendril in that it arises from the shoot apical meristem, rather than in an axil. However, a shoot apex tendril may arise either from the apex itself, in which case it is terminal, or from the side of an apical meristem, in which case it is a lateral structure. In the latter case, the main stem of the plant undergoes sympodial growth. A stem apex tendril is often located on the opposite side of a stem from a leaf at the same node, as in Vitaceae. See also leaf tendril (PO:0025361), leaflet tendril (PO:0025362), leaf apex tendril (PO:0025363), branch tendril (PO:0025364),  leaf rachis tendril (PO:0025366), and prophyll tendril (PO:0025365).

def: "A portion of meristem tissue that is found on the abaxial side of a developing phyllome." [POC:curators]
comment: Contributes to the thickness of a phyllome (PO:0006001). There are two types of adaxial meristems. In phyllomes with a petiole (PO:0020038) and lamina (PO:0025060), an adaxial rounding meristem occurs later in development, is separated from the apical meristem (PO:0020144), and contributes to the thickness of the petiole and midrib. In unifacial phyllomes, the an adaxial meristem occurs earlier in development, is close to but separate from the apical meristem, and contributes to the thickness and cross-sectional shape of the entire phyllome. If annotating to a leaf, use the more specific term leaf abaxial meristem (PO:0025403).

def: "A portion of chlorenchyma tissue that develops directly from a spore and grows by division of an apical cell to form filaments that are one cell wide and dicotomously branching." [POC:Ramona_Walls]
comment: The protonema is the first structure that develops in the gametophytic phase of mosses, some other bryophytes, and leptosporangiate ferns. The term protonema is also used to refer to the phase of development in which protonemal tissue is produced (see PO:0030006 protonema phase). In some species of moss, the protonema is perennial. A protonema may develop from sporophytic tissue during apospory.

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

[POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.
