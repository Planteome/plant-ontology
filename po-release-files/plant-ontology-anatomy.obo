comment: The sperm (microgamete) is usually larger than the egg (megagamete). In angiosperms, sperm cells are usually two in number; during double fertilization, one fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to endosperm. Male gametes may be defined as the motile gamete, rather than the smaller gamete.

Primary root tissues begin to differentiate in the root elongation zone. This term replaces elongation zone (PO:0020125).
