comment: A structure on the tuber surface that can sprout. In potatoes, axillary vegetative buds (eyes) can determine processing quality. Scale that the breeders use to rate the buds/sprouts of tubers: 1. none, 2. swollen eye, 3. sprout ca. 1/4", 4. sprout ca. 1/2", 5. sprout ca. 1", 6. sprout ca. 2", 7. sprout ca. 3", 8. new top growth, 9. chain tubers.
